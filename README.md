## Definition

**CONSTROM.io** means **_Construction Rough Order of Magnitude Estimate (ROM Estimate)_**.

ROM estimates are usually based on the estimator’s experience as well as historical data on similar projects.  We may use this kind of estimate for funding requests and budget planning.

## Development

**CONSTROM.io** is entirely programmed in **_Javascript Language_**.  At this moment, the app is executed in the computer terminal using Node.js. We expecting to continue developing the app as a Web App to be accesible in any kind of device. The app programming is developed with the following main components:

☑ MongoDB<br />
☑ Promises<br />
☑ Functions<br />
☑ Class Functions<br />
☑ Objects Array<br />
☑ Imports<br />
☑ NPM Packages

The most challenging of the project's development was being able to understand the logic of **`Promises`** and the management of **`MongoDB`**. These two components of the development were not part of the 2017 Winter Javascript Course Syllabus, so they had to be learned in a week and a half with lot of "trial and error".  I can say that these two components are the basis of the development and implementation of the app.

## Usage from command line

You need _Node.js_ installed in your computer.

Issue command **`npm install`** in your computer terminal in the directory where the app is located to install the require npm packages.

Issue the command **`node constrom.js`** in your computer terminal in the directory where the app is located to run the app.
For no color version, issue the command **`node constrom.js --no-color`**.
